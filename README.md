For the first cube on the left, I made a cube with a simple Phong material that has a gray base color and a green specular color.

For the second cube on the left, I made a cube with a Phong material with a pink base color and put a bump map I found at http://www.bundysoft.com/wiki/doku.php?id=tutorials:l3dt:bumpmap

For the cube in the middle, I made a cube that interpolated between orange and yellow using my own shaders

For the second cube on the right, I generated my own textures in Substance Painter and mapped the albedo, emissive, normal, and height maps using a Phong material.

For the first cube on the right, I made a cube with my own shaders that took in the global position of the fragment and mapped that value on a scale of -1 to 1 into 0 to 1, giving it a soft, pastel appearance.
